# Python Learning Path

This repository contains Python scripts for learning and practicing basic Python concepts.

## Files

- `lesson01.py`: A script that demonstrates basic Python concepts such as strings, integers, floats, booleans, f-strings, and typecasting.
- `tempCodeRunnerFile.py`: A temporary file used by the code runner in the IDE.

## Concepts Covered

### Strings
- Declaring and printing strings
- Using f-strings for formatting
- Concatenating strings

### Integers
- Declaring and printing integers
- Using integers in f-strings

### Floats
- Declaring and printing floats
- Using floats in f-strings

### Booleans
- Declaring and printing booleans
- Using booleans in f-strings
- Conditional statements with booleans

### Typecasting
- Converting between different data types (`str()`, `int()`, `bool()`, `float()`)
- Printing the type of variables

## Running the Scripts

To run the scripts, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python [lesson01.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)
